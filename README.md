# Image-Segmentation
<p>Image segmentation Techniques which include techniques like</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thresholding Method</li>
  <li>Edge Based Segmentation</li>
  <li>Region Based Segmentation</li>
  <li>clustering Based Segmentation</li>
  <li>Watershed Based Method </li>
  <li>Artificial Neural Network Based Segmentation</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>THRESHOLDING METHOD</h2>
 <p>Thresholding Method	Focuses on finding peak values based on the histogram of the image to find similar pixels	Doesnâ€™t require complicated pre-processing, simple	Many details can get      omitted, threshold errors are common</p>
 <p>This includes three types of methods, they are<p>
 <ul>
  <li>Simple Thresholding</li>
  <li>Adaptive Thresholding</li>
  <li>Otsu Thresholding</li>
 <ul>
